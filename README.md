### Single Scan Solutions
1. [Can place flowers](can_place_flowers.py) easy, LC #[605](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/description/)
2. [Recent Counter](./num_recent_call.py) bad, skip.

### I Don't Even Know
1. [String Compression 1](string_compression1.py) medium, really bad description. LC #[443](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

### Stack questions 
1. [Asteroid Collision](asteroid_collison.py) meidum, bad example and description. LC #[735](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision)
2. [Decode String](decode_strings.py) medium, decent example with good test case, for now I have to wait for the solution. LC #[394](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/).

### Queue questions
1. [Dota2 Senate](dota_senate.py) easy, tough description however, watched neetcode for understanding, LC #[649](https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/description/)

2. [Middle Node](middle_ll.py) easy, LC #[876](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/)
3. [Delete middle node of linked list](delete_middle_ll.py) medium, LC #[867](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/description/)
4. [Odd Even Linked List](oddeven_list.py) good question to understand Linked list, LC #[328](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/description/)

### Graph Questions
1. [Number of Islands](num_of_islands.py) So not my solution but the most basic way to solve it,**Will improve it later**, LC #[200](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/) 
2. [Key and rooms](key_and_rooms.py) I have said what I have said, LC #[841](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/description/)
3. [Number of provinces](./number_of_provinces.py) Was comparitively easier than last one, just needed to implement DFS. LC #[547](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/)
4. [Graph implementation](./Graphs.py) **This is not a leetcode question but my implementation on BFS and DFS
5. [Reorder the routes](reorder_routes.py) Had a geat time solving this, implemented the algo for DFS myself. LC #[1466](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/description/)

### Hashmap/Hashset questions
1. [Find the difference of two arrays](diff_two_arrays.py) easy question, more of these to come, LC #[2215](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays/description/)
2. [Unique Number of Occurences](unq_number_occ.py) I have said what I have said, LC #[1207](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/description/). 
3. [Determine if two strings are close](two_strings_close.py) Fun question to solve, I could have never solved it in first try. LC #[1657](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/description/)
4. [Equal rows and column pairs](./equal_rows_cols.py) Easy question, i learn't how to remove last element in a string. LC #[2352](https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-row-and-column-pairs/description/)

### Sliding Window
1. [Maximum Average Subarray I](./max_subarray_avg.py) Easy quesiton, was tough to solve in O(n), I was not locked in. LC #[643](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/description/)
2. [Maximum number of vowels in subarray](./max_vowels_sub.py) Easy question, I couldn't solve/code it. LC #[1456](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/description/)
3. [Max Consecutive III](./max_cons_3.py) tough to realise how sliding window can be used in this case. LC #[1004](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/description/)

That's all for now folks!
